        <h1>Thermodynamics</h1>
       <p>Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with heat, work,
            and temperature, and their relation to energy, radiation,and physical properties of matter. 
             The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics which 
             convey a quantitative description using measurable macroscopic
              physical quantities, but may be explained in terms of microscopic 
              constituents by statistical mechanics. 
              Thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in 
              science and engineering, especially physical chemistry,
               biochemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering,
                but also in other complex fields such as meteorology.</p>
               
                 <p>FIRST LAW:  The first law of thermodynamics is a version of the 
                     law of conservation of energy,
                      adapted for thermodynamic processes.
                      In general, the conservation law 
                      states that the total energy of an
                       isolated system is constant;
                        energy can be transformed from one form
                        to another, but can be neither created
                         nor destroyed.</p>
                
                <p>SECOND LAW:  The second law of thermodynamics indicates the irreversibility of natural processes, and, in many cases,
                     the tendency of natural processes to lead towards spatial homogeneity of matter and energy,
                      and especially of temperature. It can be formulated in a variety of interesting and important ways.
                       One of the simplest is the Clausius statement, that heat does not spontaneously pass from a colder to a hotter body.</p>
                
                <p>THIRD LAW:   The third law of thermodynamics can be stated as
                  A system's entropy approaches a constant value as 
                  its temperature approaches absolute zero.</p>

    <h1>Astrophysics</h1>
    <p>Astrophysics is a science that employs
         the methods and principles 
        of physics in the study of
         astronomical objects and phenomena.
        Among the subjects studied are 
        the Sun, other stars, galaxies, 
        extrasolar planets,
           the interstellar medium and 
           the cosmic microwave background.
            Emissions from these objects 
            are examined across all parts
             of the electromagnetic spectrum,
             and the properties examined include
              luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition.
              Because astrophysics is a 
              very broad subject, astrophysicists apply
               concepts and methods from many
               disciplines of physics, including
                classical mechanics, electromagnetism,
                 statistical mechanics, 
                  thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity,
                   nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.</p>
                   <p>In practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial
                        amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics.
                         Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the
                          properties of dark matter, dark energy, black holes, and other celestial bodies; and the origin
                           and ultimate fate of the universe. Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include 
                           Solar System formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics;
                            large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity, special relativity, quantum and
                             physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics.</p>

    <div class="Dark">
        <h1>Dark Matter</h1>
        <p>Dark matter is a form of matter thought to 
            account for approximately 85% of the matter in the
             universe and about 27% of its total mass–energy density
              or about 2.241×10−27 kg/m3. Its presence is implied in a
               variety of astrophysical observations, including
                gravitational effects that cannot be explained by
                 accepted theories of gravity unless more matter is
                  present than can be seen. For this reason, most
                   experts think that dark matter is abundant in the
                    universe and that it has had a strong influence on 
                    its structure and evolution. Dark matter is called
                     dark because it does not appear to interact with
                      the electromagnetic field, which means it does 
                      not absorb, reflect or emit electromagnetic
                       radiation, and is therefore difficult to detect.</p>
                       <p>Primary evidence for dark matter comes from calculations showing that many galaxies would fly
                            apart, or that they would not have formed or would not move as they do, if they did not contain a 
                            large amount of unseen matter. Other lines of evidence include observations in gravitational lensing
                             and in the cosmic microwave background, along with astronomical observations
                              of the observable universe's current structure, the formation and evolution of
                               galaxies, mass location during galactic collisions, and the motion of galaxies within
                                galaxy clusters. In the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, the total mass–energy of 
                                the universe contains 5% ordinary matter and energy, 27% dark matter
                                 and 68% of a form of energy known as dark energy. Thus, dark matter constitutes 85%[a] 
                                 of total mass, while dark energy plus dark matter constitute 95% of total mass–energy content.</p>

    <div class="Micro">
        <h1>Microwaves</h1>
        <p>Microwave is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths 
            ranging from about one meter to one millimeter corresponding to frequencies between 
            300 MHz and 300 GHz respectively. Different sources define different
             frequency ranges as microwaves; the above broad definition includes both UHF and EHF (millimeter wave)
              bands. A more common definition in radio-frequency engineering is the range between 1 and 100 
              GHz (wavelengths between 0.3 m and 3 mm). In all cases, microwaves include the entire SHF 
              band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum. Frequencies in the microwave range are often referred to by
               their IEEE radar band designations: S, C, X, Ku, K, or Ka band, or by similar NATO or EU designations.

            The prefix micro- in microwave is
             not meant to suggest a wavelength in the micrometer
              range. Rather, it indicates that microwaves are "small"
               (having shorter wavelengths), compared to the radio waves used prior
                to microwave technology. The boundaries between far infrared, terahertz radiation, 
                microwaves, and ultra-high-frequency radio waves are fairly arbitrary and are used variously between different fields of study.</p>
                <p>Microwaves travel by line-of-sight; unlike lower frequency radio waves they do 
                    not diffract around hills, follow the earth's surface as ground waves, or reflect
                     from the ionosphere, so terrestrial microwave communication links are limited by the
                      visual horizon to about 40 miles (64 km). At the high end of the band they are absorbed by
                       gases in the atmosphere, limiting practical communication distances to around a kilometer.
                        Microwaves are widely used in modern technology, for example in point-to-point communication links,
                         wireless networks, microwave radio relay networks, radar, satellite and spacecraft communication, 
                         medical diathermy and cancer treatment, remote sensing, radio astronomy, particle accelerators, spectroscopy,
                          industrial heating, collision avoidance systems, garage door openers and keyless entry systems, and for cooking food in microwave ovens.</p>
